# ParticleSwarm-NeuralNetwork

Vanilla back-propagation and its variants are both
a commonly used and effective way to training artificial neural
networks. Vanilla back-propagation however has a tendency to
have a long run time as it must do a forward pass through the
network to determine the error and then propagate it backwards
in order to alter the weights. In this paper we will use another
algorithm, namely particle swarm optimization, to train the
network on two datasets of varying complexity to determine its
applicability as a neural network training algorithm.
